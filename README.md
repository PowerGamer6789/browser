# Browser Information

A simple web page that shows **exactly what a website can see about your browser**.

## Live demo:  
https://powergamer6789.github.io/browser

## What it shows
- Browser & OS information
- Screen size & pixel ratio
- Language & timezone
- CPU cores & memory estimate
- Network details (when supported)
- Cookie & storage availability
- Do Not Track status

If a website can read it without permission, it’s probably here.

## Features
- Clean dark UI
- Fully client-side
- Zero dependencies
- Export all data to JSON

## Why this exists
People say “websites can see your info”  
This shows **what that actually means**.

No fear-mongering. Just facts.

## Privacy
This site:
- Does not send data anywhere
- Does not store anything
- Does not track users

Your browser exposes the data.
This page just displays it.
